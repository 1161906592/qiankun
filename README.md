# qiankun
> In Chinese traditional culture `qian` means heaven and `kun` stands for earth, so `qiankun` is the universe.

An implementation of [Micro Frontends](https://micro-frontends.org/), based on [single-spa](https://github.com/CanopyTax/single-spa), but made it production-ready.

## Roadmap

- [ ] core lib
